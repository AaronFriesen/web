    <h2> NeuroRush </h2>
    <p>
    During the summer of 2013, I formed WaveFocus LLC and contracted with New Mind Technologies, a neurofeedback clinic based in Atlanta. We spent the following 15 weeks developing, testing, and creating NeuroRush, one of the first neurofeedback-enabled video games on the market. 

    </p>

        <img alt = "..." src = "img/nrtitle.png" style = "margin-top:30px" style = "margin-bottom:30px">
        <div class = "caption"> Splash art for NeuroRush. </div>
    </div>

    <p style = "margin-top:30px">
    The premise of the game is simple: the player is a fox ninja named Kit who was tasked with guarding the ninja gold. One day, Kit was so wrapped up in his training that evil enemy lords stole Kit's gold. </p><p></p><p> The reason it was so simple to steal? Kit is blind. He can only "see" his surroundings when he is actively focused. 

    </p>

    <div class = "row text-center">
        <img alt = "..." src = "img/SceneJungleVines.png" style = "margin-top:30px">
        <div class = "caption"> Kit is blind, and can only see when the player is focused. </div>
    </div>

    <p style = "margin-top:30px">
    The player uses a standard USB Controller in addition to a neurofeedback headset which is constantly detecting the player's brainwaves. When the player is relaxed and focused, the screen is bright and the view distance of Kit is very large. If the player is frustrated or showing signs of Attention Deficit Disorder or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, the screen grows dark and Kit cannot see far at all. Over multiple sessions, the player becomes more comfortable with going to, and staying in, these "healthier" brainwave patters, eventually curing them of otherwise difficult-to-treat mental disorders.

        <img alt = "..." src = "img/SceneLibrary.png" style = "margin-top:30px">
        <div class = "caption"> Kit travels through many different areas collecting coins, such as The Great Library. </div>
    </div>

    <p style = "margin-top:30px">
    I was the Project Manager of the group. It was my job to ensure we stayed on schedule, that we consistently achieved milestones to chronicle our progress, and to address any concerns that any team member had. I also filled in on nearly every aspect of the project, from doing the relatively small-scale modeling to some of the backend code that the Lead Programmer had put on the backburner. I delegated tasks to various members of the project and ensured that everyone was able to work as efficiently as possible. In addition, I was the main source of contact to our contractor, New Mind Technologies - I made sure they were updated with how the project was progressing, doing business with them, and communicating the direction they wanted the game to go to the team.
    </p>

    <div class = "row text-center">
        <img alt = "..." src = "img/ScenePirateCove.png" style = "margin-top:30px">
        <div class = "caption"> The player must travel through 16 unique levels, each one moving Kit along the path to recollecting his gold. This one's a pirate level. </div>
    </div>

    <p style = "margin-top:30px">
    The game plays very much like a cross between Sly Cooper and Temple Run. Originally we had the game as a completely freeform stealth platformer, but members of the team expressed concern that the player would feel lost or confused, especially if their brainwave patters were doing poorly and making Kit blind. We playtested this with various levels, settings, and difficulties, and found that these concerns were serious problems. The game wasn't fun to play because of it, so we made some drastic changes to the gameplay almost halfway through production. We ended up having to throw out a decent chunk of work to do so, which while painful at the time, left us with a much better game overall.

        <img alt = "..." src = "img/SceneShipwreck.png" style = "margin-top:30px">
        <div class = "caption"> After chasing the pirate lord down, the ship wrecks and Kit must jump through the wreckage to collect the stash of coins. </div>
    </div>

    <p style = "margin-top:30px">
    We developed the game using Unity3D and Blender, used Visual Studio for coding, and mainly TortoiseSVN for source control. In retrospect, had I known of its beauty, we probably would have been using git instead. We demo'd NeuroRush in Austin, Texas at the <a href="http://www.isnr.org">ISNR Conference</a> in 2013. People were very excited and it should be hitting the market sometime soon!
