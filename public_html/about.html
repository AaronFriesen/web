    My name is Aaron Friesen, and I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student. I've been attending the Georgia Institute of Technology since Fall of 2011, and intend on graduating in the Spring of 2015. My hometown is a little town in North Georgia called Woodstock - not the one from the concert, I'm afraid. My passion has been video games for as long as I can remember, and I'm making it my mission to break into the game industry. In addition to video games, I spend a lot of time playing card games, board games, and tabletop games for a couple reasons: </p>

    <p>1. I think they're fun!</p>
    <p>2. I think there are a lot of things that each medium has to learn from each other.</p>

    <p>Some of my favorite games include League of Legends, Stepmania, Dota 2, Good ol' Warcraft 3, Magic: The Gathering (though I tend to play just Limited formats these days), Pathfinder, Mage Knight, and the Fire Emblem series. My favorite game, bar none, has to go to Fire Emblem: Awakening. The story is fantastic and the gameplay covers the entire spectrum from easy to mind-bogglingly impossible. The only thing the game is missing is a strong multiplayer mechanic (what I wouldn't give to play against people's teams head-to-head), though the Streetpass team share mechanic does fill in for that somewhat. I could go on for days about FE:A. Long story short: if you enjoy strategy games, play it. It's fantastic.
    </p>

    <p>I've been running Pathfinder games for about 5 years now and I enjoy it quite a bit. Being a DM really helps get the creative juices flowing, so to speak. They let you create a world and collectively write a story with your players. My most recent games include a somewhat standard game in a custom setting - it mostly revolved around subverting an evil Elf Queen who was attempting to resurrect an ancient world-eating monster. I also co-ran a game where the players were all Greek demigods coming into their own, finding out about their godly heritage and encountering famous Greek mythos such as The Fates and Hephaestus.</p>
    
    <p>Recently I've been very interested in <a href = "http://hextcg.com">Hex</a>, one of the first MMOTCGs out there. It's essentially a Hearthstone competitor with some neat RPG elements as well, such as multiplayer dungeons with boss enemies. I applied to their Cryptozoic Apprentice program for game design and made it quite far in the interview process - all told, I ended up creating about 20 pages of card designs and answering quite a few Game Theory questions. I learned quite a bit from the experience and I think it's made me understand a lot more about how games are made. I'm still looking for an internship for the summer of 2014, but I'm confident that my newly-honed game design skills will get me where I want to be. </p>
