      <p>Starting June of 2015, I began working for Amazon Web Services (AWS) on their
      <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/training/?nc2=h_l2_tr">Training & Certification</a> team.
      There weren't very many developers on the team
      when I started, so it's been a unique experience to help lay the groundwork for
      future team culture and processes. I wasn't very experienced in web development
      when I started (as this barebones website probably informs you of),
      but I've been able to learn a lot so far along the way. We do full-stack
      development on AWS services, which is a bit of a unique opportunity in
      Amazon as a whole - I wasn't terribly keen on getting pidgeonholed into
      doing super-low-level DB work the rest of my career so that's been a major plus.</p>

      <p>I can't talk too in too many specifics about what I've been working on,
      but suffice to say I think it's really exciting. Hopefully I'll have more
      to share here soon!</p>
