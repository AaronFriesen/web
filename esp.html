    ESP, or the Entertainment Software Producers, is a <a href = "http://gtesp.com">video game club at Georgia Tech</a>. It's about games as a whole - playing games, making games, and designing games. We also talk about weekly video game news and what's going on in the game industry. From Fall 2012 to Spring 2013, I was the Club Treasurer. </p>

    <p>I handled meeting organization, topic presentations, and was the dues officer. I made sure everyone paid the club fees and ordered pizza, as well as planned for game design competitions and ordered prizes for them. It was a fun leadership role that allowed me to show others cool things about games they may never have heard of. There were 57 members of the club the semesters I was Treasurer, and we held 4 Game Design competitions over the course of the school year. Thanks to anonymous voting, I actually ended up winning 2! </p>

    <p>Some activities we did during the year include:</p>
    <p>Board Game De-Makes, where people had a week to "de-make" a game into a board game. My game was The Binding of Isaac, and I ended up making the game a multiplayer roguelike explorer with dice-based room rolls.</p>
    <p>Combo Design Challenges, where participants were given an emotion and a game genre and tasked to come up with the best elevator pitch for a game based off of those emotion and genre pairs.</p>
    <p>Genre Debates, where participants were tasked with breaking into groups and were randomly given genres of games. They then needed to identify aspects of those genres which set them apart from other genres and what aspects they shared with other genres.</p>
    <p>Additionally, we held multiple debates throughout the school year, on topics ranging from "What does a game need to succeed?", "What role does sound play in different genres?", and "What makes party games effective in parties?". Finally, we had multiple guest speakers come in to discuss various topics of game design, from rapid paper prototyping to long-term team development. Scheduling these speakers was my job as well.</p>
