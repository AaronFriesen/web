    My name is Aaron Friesen, and I'm an SDE working at Amazon Web Services. I graduated from Georgia Tech with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in Spring 2015. My hometown is a suburb of Atlanta known as Woodstock, but these days I'm living in Seattle, Washington.

    While I was at Georgia Tech, I did a number of things, including (but not limited to): Head Teaching Assistant of CS1331, Treasurer of campus gaming club ESP, CEO of startup WaveFocus LLC, SDE Intern at Yelp, Inc., and was a member of various clubs and orgs. All things considered, those were some pretty hectic times. Life has since slowed down considerably, as it tends to do when you start working full-time. These days I'm fiddling with various web dev technologies and playing video games.
