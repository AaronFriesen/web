    <h2>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</h3>

    <p>
    Spring 2012, I started work as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (TA) for Georgia Tech's CS 1331, Introduction to Object Oriented Programming. It covers in-depth Java programming as well as object-oriented programming principles and design. I taught weekly recitations to 50 people per semester, as well as held office hours for one-on-one student help. I was also responsible for grading homeworks and tests on a regular basis. I was a TA for 4 semesters today before I was promoted to be the Head TA.

    As the Head TA, I was in charge of managing the other TAs. I made sure that everyone knew what they were doing on a weekly basis as well as coordinated their office hours and grading. I delegated responsibility for writing homeworks to the TAs, though I also write a fair number myself. I wrote weekly recitation guides so the TAs could all consistently teach to GT standards. I was the Head TA for CS 1331 for 3 semesters  and it was a very rewarding experience.

    Being the Head TA was about 20 hours of work per week, between scheduling TA duties, working on homeworks, and communicating with students. It was a non-trivial amount of work, but it has been some of the most enjoyable work I've done so far. Some examples of lectures I have given: </p>
