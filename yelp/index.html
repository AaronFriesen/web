      <h2>Yelp</h3>
      <p>During the Summer of 2014, I worked as a Software Engineering
      intern for Yelp at their San Francisco HQ. I worked on their
      Internationalization team (i18n) building internal and external
      tools to facilitate Yelp expanding to new countries.</p>
      <p>It was a fantastic experience - I learned about working in a
      large code base for the first time and getting work done on a big
      team. I was able to further hone my skills on SCRUM development
      with weekly code sprints, as well as overall task management and
      task estimation skills. My favorite part, though, was all of the
      awesome people I got to meet during my time there!</p>

      I had the opportunity to meet so many other awesome people, not just at Yelp but in the Bay area.
      Above are the other i18nterns I worked with - Eoin, Luis, Elizabeth, myself, and Brandon. Below
      are some of the friends I made in San Francisco for our weekly Sunday Brunch.

      I was also able to go white water rafting with my teammates during my internship -
      here we have myself, my manager Alex Levy, and one of my teammates Alan Quach.
